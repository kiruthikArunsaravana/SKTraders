/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SK Traders Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes rapid development by granting broad access to
 * authenticated users. It aims to prevent unauthorized data modification
 * and exposure while allowing for flexible data shapes during prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. Access is restricted to the
 *   owning user.
 * - All other collections: Public read/write for any authenticated user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to prevent data harvesting.
 * - Write access to all collections (except users) is allowed for any signed-in
 *   user to simplify development. This is a permissive rule for prototyping.
 * - A specific `allow get` is added to products to allow transactions to read
 *   stock levels before updating.
