/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SK Traders.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model. Users can read all data,
 * but writes are restricted based on their role (Admin, Manager, Employee) and document ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, including roles.
 * - /clients/{clientId}: Stores client data.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information.
 * - /stocks/{stockId}: Stores stock levels.
 * - /sales/{saleId}: Stores sale transactions.
 * - /purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase transactions.
 * - /receipts/{receiptId}: Stores receipts related to sales and purchases.
 * - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records.
 * - /exports/{exportId}: Stores export order details.
 * - /local_sales/{localSaleId}: Stores local sale order details.
 * - /financial_transactions/{transactionId}: Stores financial transactions (income and expenses).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All data is readable by any authenticated user for reporting purposes, in order to provide visibility to all staff.
 * - User listing is not allowed.
 * - All write operations are only permitted for authenticated users with the role of admin, manager, or employee
 * - The rules are designed to be flexible on data shapes for prototyping purposes.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The user's role is denormalized into the /users/{userId} document to allow for efficient role-based access control.
