/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles. Each user can only
 * read and write their own profile data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. The {userId} must match the
 *   authenticated user's UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private and only accessible to the owning user.
 * - Users can only create their own profile with a matching user ID.
 * - Listing all users is not permitted.
