/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SK Traders application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure access control based on user roles and
 * ownership. It allows flexible data schemas for prototyping, focusing on
 * authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the user itself (owner-only).
 * - /clients/{clientId}: Stores client information. Accessible to all logged in users.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information. Accessible to all logged in users.
 * - /stocks/{stockId}: Stores stock information. Accessible to all logged in users.
 * - /sales/{saleId}: Stores sales transactions. Accessible to all logged in users.
 * - /purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase transactions. Accessible to all logged in users.
 * - /receipts/{receiptId}: Stores receipts. Accessible to all logged in users.
 * - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records. Accessible to all logged in users.
 * - /exports/{exportId}: Stores export orders. Accessible to all logged in users.
 * - /local_sales/{localSaleId}: Stores local sale orders. Accessible to all logged in users.
 * - /financial_transactions/{transactionId}: Stores financial transaction. Accessible to all logged in users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All collections outside /users/{userId} are accessible to all authenticated users.
