/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict owner-only access model for user data.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only authenticated users
 * can access their own information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains user profile information.
 * - /financial_transactions: Intended to be publicly available. Documents should contain an `ownerId` field.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Listing all users is forbidden.
 * - Public read access is allowed for the `financial_transactions` collection, but writes are restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `financial_transactions` collection should contain an `ownerId` field on each document,
 *   matching the UID of the user who created it. This is essential for secure write access.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles are stored in a private /users/{userId} collection, while public content is in the top-level
 *   `financial_transactions` collection.
