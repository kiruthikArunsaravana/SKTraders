/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict owner-only access model for user profiles and public read access for other collections, with owner-only writes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /clients/{clientId}: Stores client information, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 * - /stocks/{stockId}: Stores stock information, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 * - /sales/{saleId}: Stores sales transaction data, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 * - /purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase data, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 * - /receipts/{receiptId}: Stores receipt data, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 * - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense data, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 * - /exports/{exportId}: Stores export data, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 * - /local_sales/{localSaleId}: Stores local sale data, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 * - /financial_transactions/{transactionId}: Stores financial transaction data, publicly readable, but writable only by owners (must implement owner field).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Other collections adopt a public-read, owner-write pattern.
 * - Missing ownership fields in several entities will trigger TODO alerts in the rules.
